  - Properly terminates video streaming sessions
  - Helps prevent simultaneous access violations

#### 3. Access Validation (Requirement 3.1)
- **GET** `/api/videostreaming/validate-access/{moduleId}` - Validate video access
  - Validates user access to specific video content
  - Returns access status and remaining days

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization (Requirement 3.1)
- All course content endpoints require JWT authentication
- User identity validation through claims
- Ownership validation for user-specific resources
- Role-based access control where applicable

### Secure Video Streaming (Requirement 3.2)
- Time-limited secure URLs prevent unauthorized access
- Session-based video access tracking
- Prevention of video downloads through secure streaming
- Expiration time limits for security (max 120 minutes)

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive parameter validation
- GUID validation for resource identifiers
- Range validation for numeric parameters
- Null and empty string checks

## Error Handling

### Standardized Error Responses
- Consistent HTTP status codes
- Descriptive error messages
- Proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Graceful degradation for service failures

### Security Error Handling
- Unauthorized access returns 401 status
- Forbidden access returns 403 status
- Resource not found returns 404 status
- Validation errors return 400 status with details

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 3.1**: Secure authentication for course content access
